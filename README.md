[00:07.04] You made plans and I, I made problems
[00:11.12] We were sleeping back to back
[00:13.91] We know this thing wasn't built to last, yeah
[00:36.41] 
[00:16.36] Good on paper, picture perfect
[00:20.86] Chased the high too far, too fast
[00:23.06] Picket white fence, but we paint it black
[00:43.56] 
[00:25.92] Ooh, and I wished that you would hurt me harder than I hurt you
[00:29.98] Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do
[00:59.48] 
[00:35.23] I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
[00:41.90] Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I made
[00:46.73] Someone you don't have to change
[01:02.73] 
[00:49.03] I've been hoping
[00:51.57] Someone will love you, let me go
[01:07.57] 
[01:00.49] Someone will love you, let me go
[01:07.90] I've been hoping
[01:09.92] Someone will love you, let me go
[01:25.92] 
[01:12.02] Spend some time, but this time ain't even
[01:16.53] I can leave it in the past
[01:18.71] But you're holding onto what you never had, it's
[01:42.71] 
[01:21.60] Good on paper, picture perfect
[01:25.86] Chased the high too far, too fast
[01:27.97] Picket white fence, but we paint it black
[01:48.47] 
[01:30.64] Ooh, and I wished that you would hurt me harder than I hurt you
[01:35.01] Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do
[02:04.51] 
[01:40.08] I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
[01:46.71] Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I made
[01:51.72] Someone you don't have to change
[02:07.72] 
[01:54.05] I've been hoping
[01:56.85] Someone will love you, let me go
[02:12.85] 
[02:05.22] Someone will love you, let me go
[02:13.26] I've been hoping
[02:15.49] Someone will love you, let me go, go, go
[02:35.49] 
[02:21.03] Someone will love you, let me go, go, go
[02:25.16] Someone will love you, let me go, go, go
[02:29.66] Someone will love you, let me go, go, go
[02:34.30] Someone will love you, let me go
[02:50.30] 
[02:36.73] I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
[02:43.66] Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I made
[02:48.28] Someone you don't have to change
[03:04.28] 
[02:50.26] I've been hoping
[02:53.37] Someone will love you, let me go
